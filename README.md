# IRIS-flower-Classification-using-ML-in-python
so, here we are with a MAchine learning project which is used to classify the flower. Since setosa, verginica etc are of same type same colour but are diffrent flower. But due to same colour and design it is hard to classify them. But using ML we can classify. In this project we will take we will crate diffrent model to classify them and also will check the accuracy of diffrent model. we have created the whole project in a Grafic cal user interface.
This is Machine learning project and we can say the first project of machine learning beginers.
In machine learning the main objective is to make the machine learn from diffrent data ao that when ever any data is entered it will show the corresponding result.
So here in this project we imported the data of iris flower i.e., settal length and width, pettal length and width. the file which is imported is having data of several Iris flower so that our system will learn from diffrent datas and can predict the best.
After that we have created four model to predict the result and trained those model too, using the datas of the siris flowers.
here we will also check the accuracy of diffrent model, thats why we are creating diffrent model.
after that we created our grafical user interface and diffrent fucnctions.
while running the program you will found that KNN model is predicting the result most accuratly as compared to other project.
